## Summary

I built this android application using Flutter to understand a new programming language.
From this I have gathered Flutter is useful for UI design and the rough outline of a project can be easily created using Flutter.
The notes app garners many widgets to harness the power of Dart and it even has a Google Ads functionality built in. 
The packages, API, or general information on Flutter is easily accessed through their main website and a lot of the tutorials make it easy to work off of.
